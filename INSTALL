Installing kcp is a pretty straighforward task.

1. DEPENDS
  Ensure the needed depends are installed on your system:
	- A go compiler (by default, go)
	- git (to make the compiled app work)

2. COMPILATION
	Just launch the following command:
	  make
	This command will build the binary file, then launch this binary to create the man file.
  Nota: if you don't use the default go compiler (for example gcc-go), precise it (not tested):
		make GOCMD=<your compiler>

3. INSTALL
	Launch the following command:
	  make DESTDIR=<yourdestdir> install
	As result:
		- the binary file will be installed on <yourdestdir>/usr/bin
		- the man file will be installed on <yourdestdir>/usr/share/man/man1

4. ENJOY!
